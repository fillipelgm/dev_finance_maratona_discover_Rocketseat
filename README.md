<strong>Finance control web app that uses localStorage.</strong>
<br>
<br>
<br>

**I added the following functionalities to the basic version:**

- The current date is set as default when inserting a new transaction
- Transactions are separated by month/year instead of being listed according to their insertion order
- Automatically calculate monthly balances. Hover the pointer over a month/year descriptor to see the hidden card (only works in >1200px wide screens)
